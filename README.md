## Object Orianted Programming Principles in Java

  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism

### Abstraction
Direct access to the properties of the object is prevented and access is provided by getter and setter methods.

```bash
class com.app.oop_principles.abstraction.Dog is relaxed.
The dog says(notEat): I am so hungry.
```

### Encapsulation
Direct access to the properties of the object is prevented and access is provided by getter and setter methods.

```bash
Username: OzgurAkinci
Password: null
```

### Inheritance
In this example, a cat and mouse inherit the characteristics of the animal class.

```bash
Mouse is 2 kg.
Cat is 12 kg.
The cat ate the mouse.
Mouse isDead: true
Cat is 14
```

### Polymorphism
This program calculates the increased salaries to be paid to employees who receive a raise.

```bash
com.app.oop_principles.polymorphism.Officer: Main Salary: 5000, Total Salary: 6000
com.app.oop_principles.polymorphism.Worker: Main Salary: 5000, Total Salary: 6250
```
